    <div hidden id="1">On the third day of rain they had killed so many crabs inside the house that Pelayo had to cross his drenched courtyard and throw them into the sea</div>
    <div hidden id="2">The world had been sad since Tuesday</div>
    <div  hidden id="3">the newborn child had a temperature all night and they thought it was due to the stench.</div>
    <div hidden id="4">He had to go very close to see that it was an old man, a very old man, lying face down in the mud, who, in spite of his tremendous efforts, couldn't get up, impeded by his enormous wings.</div>
    <div hidden id="5">Frightened by that nightmare, Pelayo ran to get Elisenda, his wife, who was putting compresses on the sick child, and he took her to the rear of the courtyard. </div>
    <div hidden id="6">They both looked at the fallen body with a mute stupor.</div>
    <div hidden id="7">Pelayo watched over him all afternoon from the kitchen, armed with his bailiff's club, and before going to bed he dragged him out of the mud and locked him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop.</div>
    <div hidden id="8">when they went out into the courtyard with the first light of dawn, they found the whole neighborhood in front of the chicken coop having fun with the angel, without the slightest reverence, tossing him things to eat through the openings in the wire as if he weren’t a supernatural creature but a circus animal.</div>
    <div hidden id="9">Father Gonzaga arrived before seven o’clock, alarmed at the strange news. The parish priest had his first suspicion of an imposter when he saw that he did not understand the language of God or know how to greet His ministers. </div>
    <div hidden id="10">He awoke with a start, ranting in his hermetic language and with tears in his eyes, and he flapped his wings a couple of times, which brought on a whirlwind of chicken dung and lunar dust and a gale of panic that did not seem to be of this world. </div>
    <div hidden id="11"> They both came down with the chicken pox at the same time. The doctor who took care of the child couldn’t resist the temptation to listen to the angel’s heart, and he found so much whistling in the heart and so many sounds in his kidneys that it seemed impossible for him to be alive</div>
    <div hidden id="12">Then she went to the window and caught the angel in his first attempts at flight.  But he did manage to gain altitude. Elisenda let out a sigh of relief, for herself and for him, when she watched him pass over the last houses, holding himself up in some way with the risky flapping of a senile vulture.</div>
